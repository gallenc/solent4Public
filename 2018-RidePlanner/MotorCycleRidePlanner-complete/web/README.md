## Jetty Web App

To run this application use 
```
mvn jetty:run
```

## Web UI

The application should be available at http://localhost:8680

You can create,delete and update entities using the app

On first run the username is admin and password is admin

This will allow you to create and manage alternative accounts.

## ReST

Two rest endpoints are provided in the example.

```
retreive allows you to retreive a specific entity

GET http://localhost:8680/rest/example/retrieve

retrievematching allows you to search for an entity using a template

POST http://localhost:8680/rest/example/retrievematching
```
These end points are implimented by the class 
[ExampleProjectRestImpl.java](../web//web/src/main/java/solent/ac/uk/ood/examples/exampleproject/web/rest/ExampleProjectRestImpl.java
)

You can do experiments with these ReST endpoints by installing the Firefox RESTer plugin
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/rester/

RESTer allows you to create GET or POST requests and to change the request headers to change between an XML response or JSON reponse.

You can import example rest requests for this app to rester (or postman) from

[rester-export-postman.json](../web/rester-postman/rester-export-postman.json)

The example/retrieve shows how to request a single entiry using GET
